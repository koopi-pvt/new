# Custom Subdomain Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented custom subdomain routing for Koopi stores. All stores are now accessible via `<storename>.koopi.online` format instead of `koopi.online/store/<storename>`.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Middleware for Subdomain Routing (`/app/src/middleware.ts`)
- Detects subdomain from incoming requests
- Rewrites subdomain requests to `/store/[storeName]` internally
- Redirects old path-based URLs (`/store/name`) to new subdomain URLs (`name.koopi.online`)
- Handles www redirects to non-www
- Excludes localhost and preview domains for development

**Key Features:**
- Transparent subdomain to path rewriting
- 301 redirects from old URLs to maintain SEO
- Works seamlessly with Next.js App Router

### 2. Netlify Configuration (`/app/netlify.toml`)
- Build command and publish directory settings
- Redirect configuration for serverless functions
- Security headers (X-Frame-Options, CSP, etc.)
- Ready for Netlify deployment

### 3. Updated Components

#### Dashboard Page (`/app/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- Generates subdomain URLs for stores
- Falls back to path-based URLs on localhost for development
- Format: `https://storename.koopi.online` (production)
- Format: `http://localhost:3000/store/storename` (development)

#### Website Settings Page (`/app/src/app/dashboard/website/page.tsx`)
- Shows subdomain URL in store settings
- Updates "View Site" link to use subdomain
- Displays correct URL format based on environment

#### Welcome Card (`/app/src/components/dashboard/WelcomeCard.tsx`)
- Shows subdomain URL when store is enabled
- Environment-aware URL generation

### 4. Environment Configuration

**Added to `.env.local`:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_DOMAIN=koopi.online
```

**Created `.env.example`** with all required environment variables for deployment

### 5. Documentation

Created three comprehensive guides:

#### a. DNS_SETUP_GUIDE.md
Complete DNS configuration instructions including:
- Netlify DNS setup (recommended)
- Manual DNS provider setup (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc.)
- Wildcard subdomain configuration (`*.koopi.online`)
- SSL certificate provisioning
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Provider-specific instructions

#### b. NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
Step-by-step Netlify deployment including:
- Repository preparation
- Netlify site creation
- Environment variable configuration
- Custom domain setup
- SSL/HTTPS configuration
- Testing procedures
- Continuous deployment setup
- Monitoring and rollback procedures

#### c. FIX_SUMMARY.md
Documents the previous bug fix (Social Media Kit card issue)

## How It Works

### Request Flow

1. **User visits**: `https://shop1.koopi.online`
2. **DNS resolves** to Netlify server (via wildcard CNAME)
3. **Middleware intercepts** request and detects subdomain `shop1`
4. **Next.js rewrites** internally to `/store/shop1`
5. **Store page renders** with correct store data
6. **User sees**: Store at `shop1.koopi.online` (clean URL)

### Old URL Redirects

1. **User visits**: `https://koopi.online/store/shop1`
2. **Middleware intercepts** and detects old URL format
3. **301 redirect** issued to `https://shop1.koopi.online`
4. **User sees**: Redirect to new subdomain URL

### Development Mode

On localhost:
- Uses path-based URLs: `http://localhost:3000/store/shop1`
- No subdomain routing (for easier local testing)
- Automatically switches to subdomain URLs in production

## DNS Configuration Required

### Essential DNS Records

For `koopi.online` domain:

```
# Main domain
Type: CNAME
Name: @
Value: your-site.netlify.app

# Wildcard subdomains (CRITICAL)
Type: CNAME
Name: *
Value: your-site.netlify.app

# WWW subdomain (optional)
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: your-site.netlify.app
```

**Note:** The wildcard record (`*`) is ESSENTIAL for all store subdomains to work!

## Netlify Configuration Required

### Custom Domains to Add:
1. `koopi.online` (main domain)
2. `*.koopi.online` (wildcard subdomain)

### Environment Variables to Set:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_DOMAIN=koopi.online
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Middleware compiles without errors ✅
- [ ] Main domain shows landing page (`koopi.online`)
- [ ] Store accessible via subdomain (`storename.koopi.online`)
- [ ] Old URLs redirect to new subdomains
- [ ] HTTPS works on all subdomains
- [ ] Store creation generates correct subdomain URL
- [ ] Dashboard shows correct store URL
- [ ] Website settings show correct URL
- [ ] Social Media Kit uses correct URL

## Deployment Steps

### Quick Deployment:

1. **Push code to Git repository**
2. **Create Netlify site** from repository
3. **Add environment variables** in Netlify dashboard
4. **Add custom domains**: `koopi.online` and `*.koopi.online`
5. **Configure DNS** (see DNS_SETUP_GUIDE.md)
6. **Wait for DNS propagation** (1-24 hours)
7. **Verify SSL certificate** is issued
8. **Test subdomains** work correctly

See `NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for detailed step-by-step instructions.

## Benefits of This Implementation

### For Users:
✅ Cleaner, more professional URLs
✅ Easy to remember: `storename.koopi.online`
✅ Each store feels independent
✅ Better for branding and marketing

### For SEO:
✅ Better URL structure
✅ Subdomain isolation
✅ Easier to track per-store analytics
✅ Better for search engine indexing

### For Development:
✅ Works on localhost without subdomain setup
✅ Automatic URL generation
✅ Backward compatible with old URLs
✅ Easy to test and debug

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Old URLs automatically redirect to new format
- ✅ Existing store links will continue to work
- ✅ SEO preserved with 301 redirects
- ✅ No database changes required
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Netlify** using the deployment guide
2. **Configure DNS** using the DNS setup guide
3. **Test thoroughly** using the testing checklist
4. **Update Firebase** authorized domains
5. **Monitor** for any issues in first few days
6. **Update marketing materials** with new URL format
